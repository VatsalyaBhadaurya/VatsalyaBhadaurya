## 🧠 About Me

I work on **real-world AI systems for robotics**, with a primary focus on **humanoid perception, behavior intelligence, and embodied decision-making**.

My work lives at the intersection of:
- applied machine learning  
- robotics systems engineering  
- on-device deployment  

where models must function **reliably under real constraints** — noisy sensors, limited compute, latency budgets, and unpredictable environments — not just controlled simulations.

I am currently an **AI Intern in the R&D team at a humanoid robotics startup**, working directly on:
- perception pipelines  
- speech → intent → action systems  
- behavior logic and state machines  
- ROS2-based architectures  
- edge deployment on **NVIDIA Jetson** platforms  

Previously, I’ve worked on **industrial-grade vision systems deployed in automotive manufacturing** and co-authored an **IEEE research paper** on multimodal sensing systems.
