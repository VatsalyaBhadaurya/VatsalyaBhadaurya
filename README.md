### About Me

I work on real world AI systems for robotics, with a primary focus on **humanoid perception, behavior intelligence, and embodied AI**. My work lies at the intersection of applied machine learning, robotics systems engineering, and on device deployment, where models must operate reliably under real world constraints rather than controlled simulations.

I am currently an **AI Intern in the R&D team at a humanoid robotics startup**, working on perception pipelines, speech to intent to action systems, behavior logic, ROS2 based architectures, and edge deployment on Jetson platforms. I have also worked on **industrial grade vision systems deployed in automotive manufacturing environments** and authored an **IEEE research paper** on multimodal sensing systems.
