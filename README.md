## Hi, I’m Vatsalya 👋

I work on real world AI systems for robotics, with a primary focus on humanoid perception, behavior intelligence, and embodied AI. My work sits at the intersection of applied machine learning, robotics systems engineering, and on device deployment, where models must function reliably under real world constraints rather than controlled simulations.

I am currently an AI Intern in the R and D team at a humanoid robotics company, working on perception pipelines, speech to intent to action systems, behavior logic, ROS2 based architectures, and edge deployment on Jetson platforms. I have also worked on industrial grade vision systems deployed in automotive manufacturing environments and authored an IEEE research paper on multimodal sensing systems.

My long term interest lies in building intelligent robotic systems that perceive, reason, and act robustly in real environments such as factories, hospitals, and public spaces.
